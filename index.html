				<h2>What I hope to get out of Web Foundations</h2>
				<p>I found the PCS JavaScript evening programs and quickly realized I didn't quite have the foundation to start off with one of those, and honestly I was a little leery of diving right in at that price tag, so the foundations series seemed like a good way to dip my toe in the water. What I would really like to get is this:</p>
				<ol>
					<li>An idea of whether my instinct about development as a career is right, and whether I am cut out for it.</li>
					<li>An idea of what I might expect out of either the Full Stack or Ruby On Rails evening courses.</li>
					<li>An idea of which course to take to be able to get an entry level development position.</li>
					<li>The skills to not be totally lost in either of those courses.</li>
					<li>Some friendly coding buddies would be a nice plus.</li>
				</ol>

				<h2>Concerns</h2>
				<ul>
					<li>I don't know any JavaScrip.</li>
					<li>I know very little CSS.</li>
					<li>I don't know how to make my command line work right.</li>
					<li>I don't know how to use Git yet!</li>
					<li>I only have windows PCs.</li>
				</ul>

			  <h2>Every card has a title</h2>
			  <p>This card has a <strong>paragraph</strong> of <span class="redText">text</span> with a <a href="http://www.google.com">link</a>. It also has a <em>second</em> <span class="blueText">sentence</span> of <span class="strikeText">text</span> with a <a href="http://www.portlandcodeschool.com">link</a></p>

			  <h2>Every card has a width</h2>
			  <p><strong>But</strong> we <em>never</em> use pixels ("px") to determine the size of a card.
			  <p>We use measurements that <em>flex</em>, like percents (%) or that relate to the size of the content, like <em>root</em> "em" units (rem), which relate the size of the element to the text size and thus make the card very readable.</p>
			</article>
			<article>
			  <h2>This card has lists</h2>
			  <p>Lists are everywhere in web applications. They are used for navigation (a list of links):
				<ul>
				  <li><a href="http://www.google.com">go here</a></li>
				  <li><a href="http://www.wikipedia.org">go there</a></li>
				  <li><a href="http://www.trimet.org">go someplace else</a></li>
				</ul>
				  <p>My favorite colors</p>
				<ul>
				  <li><span class="redText">red</span></li>
				  <li><span class="blueText">blue</span></li>
				  <li><span class="greenText">green</span></li>  
				</ul>

			  <h2>Wireframes are Low Fidelity</h2>
			  <p>Wireframes are a rough sketch to help the client understand the layout of content and should not be stuck to exactly.
			  Some of our assignments will be very very vague.</p>
